[ ] windowed decoding of HMMs?
    - decode
    - predict_proba
    - predict
    - score_samples
    - score
    - fit
    - fit_ext
    - decode_ext
    - Should just have a private helper function for this inside PoissonHMM
[ ] adjust firing rate when decoding PBEs
[ ] memoryless time swap
    - mode evaluation
    - posterior evaluation
[ ] event boundary determination (trimming)
[ ] event comparison across all modalities
[ ] session aggregation
[ ] ...

[ ] log prob with MAP decoding seems weird... Shoulnd't log prob P(Y_1:T)
    be independent of decoding algorithm anyway?

[ ] pomegranate (at leat YAHMM) was [very] slow for me; but it still seems
    like a really nice package, with a clear goal, and super nice flexibility
    e.g. mixtures of HMMs, which would be awesome for hippocampal work.
    Maybe reconsider? http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html

Q. Kourosh's surrogate model suggests a transposed transmat A is used?
Q. Kourosh does no windowed decoding?
Q. How can surrogate models lead to any variation PER BIN when only the
   transmat is shuffled, and when decoding is MEMORYLESS?
Q. percentiles seem to be relaxed to ge rather than gt, but first and
   6th example bins do not seem to be consistent (might just be that
   we don't have the resolution here,...)

* integrate unimodal into nelpy
* psth, isi, fano-factor, ... (easy and not important)

* rename decoding to ML
* singletons in EpochArray
